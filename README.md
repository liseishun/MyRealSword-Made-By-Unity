# MyRealSword-Made-By-Unity
This is me and my two friends first game for our portfolio to entry the college. This game took two and a half weeks to develop, but my friend and I are still high-school students, we were only able to develop it at home. Anyway, thanks for playing our first game (thank you so much)
